# Repo for thesis at ITP

Wonder Corner is a participatory installation that invites adults into a private and safe space to wonder about the world. It is a place where no one can see or hear them and they can ask anything they want.

*Phone interaction*

My research showed that a phone is the most trusted object for people to leave their questions, and so it is one of the main objects in the installation. I used Asterisk, an open source software for communication applications, to turn an analog phone into a digital one and coded the interactions that include an analog to voice adaptor (Sipura), Ethernet cable and Internet connection, Asterisk and DigitalOcean droplet that lets me run my program on a server and be available everywhere.

*Website*

The website uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; separate Python script runs in the background to bring in new data. I am using Google Could Speech API and Speech Recognition module for Python to transcribe the audio.
